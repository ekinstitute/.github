# Embodied Knowledge Institute

We build tools and spaces for sustained inquiry into complex human experiences.

## What We Do

We develop open-source tools that help people trace origins, recognize patterns, and work systematically with difficult questions. Our projects treat lived experience as legitimate data and restore overlooked context.

Current focus: computational research tools, experience tracking systems, and frameworks for deeper inquiry.

## Open Source

We believe the best tools for inquiry are built collaboratively. We're opening our code, methods, and processes as we develop them—inviting others to contribute, adapt, and improve.
